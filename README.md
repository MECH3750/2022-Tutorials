# Tutorial Content

As we go, tutorial content, and other relevant documents, will be uploaded to
this repository. Feel free to clone this repository, and play around with the
code! Content will be sorted into folders by week, any will contain code that
is developed during any tutorial session.

## Setting up your Python Environment

While there are many Python distributions, it is significantly easier to use one that comes with a package manager, so you don't have to worry about conflicting packages. For this course, we will be using the conda package manager, which is available through either:
### - [Anaconda](www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
You might already have this installed from MECH2700. This is the most
complete data-science toolkit, coming with nearly all the packages you'll ever
need already bundled. It also comes with Spyder, which is a common editor for
Python in the data-science community.

To install new packages, launch the [Anaconda Navigator](docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/), and click on the Environments tab. The Navigator is also where you can update Spyder.

### - [Miniconda](docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
This is essentially a super lightweight version of Anaconda, and comes with the package manager conda, and Python. Try it if you want to get used to a cleaner experience, use your own editor, or just want to free up some disk-space!

To install new packages, run `conda install <package>` in your preferred terminal.

## Getting Started with GitHub

You can sign up for a free GitHub account at github.com/join. We recommend that you get familiar with the basics of GitHub before your assignments. Many people use GitHub to store their work for many projects they work on, as it also serves as a fantastic boost to your resume!

For the local git client that runs on your computer, you can use

### - [GitHub Desktop](desktop.github.com) (Recommended)
This is a graphics based program, and gives you nearly full control of git without having to touch the command line. Simply install, sign into your GitHub, and get going!

### - [git](git-scm.com/downloads) + bash
Basic as it comes, this is just an install of git that you can run from your
preferred terminal. Again, try it if you fancy a cleaner experience, want to
use your own editor, or just want to look cool.
